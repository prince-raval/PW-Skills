    "This helps in preventing the program from crashing and allows it to handle errors in a user-friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user enters invalid input or if there is a division by zero, exception handling can catch the error and display a message, instead of letting the program stop unexpectedly.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Using Multiple `except` Blocks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write separate `except` blocks for different types of exceptions. This allows you to handle each error in a specific way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in words:\n",
    "If the user enters something that's not a number, a `ValueError` will occur.\n",
    "If the user enters zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur.\n",
    "You can write two `except` blocks—one for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Using One `except` Block for Multiple Exceptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can group multiple exceptions into one `except` block using parentheses.\n",
    "This is useful when you want the same response for different kinds of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in words:\n",
    "You can group `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError` together and print a common message if either of them occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Catching All Exceptions (Using `except Exception`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also catch all types of exceptions using a general `except Exception` block.\n",
    "This will catch any error, but it doesn’t tell you exactly what kind of error occurred unless you check the exception message.\n",

    "**In summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **separate `except` blocks** to handle different errors differently.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s garbage collection system is responsible for **automatically freeing up memory** that is no longer needed by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reference Counting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Every object in Python has a **reference count**—the number of references pointing to it.\n",
    "   * When an object is created, its reference count is set to 1.\n",
    "   * When new references are made to the object, the count increases.\n",
    "   * When references are deleted or go out of scope, the count decreases.\n",
    "   * When the reference count drops to zero, Python **immediately deallocates** (frees) that object’s memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Garbage Collector for Cycles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Reference counting can’t handle **circular references**, where two or more objects reference each other, preventing their counts from ever reaching zero.\n",
    "   * Python uses a **garbage collector** module (`gc`) to detect and clean up these reference cycles.\n",
    "   * The garbage collector periodically searches for groups of objects involved in circular references and frees them if they are no longer reachable from the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s garbage collection works mainly through **reference counting** to free unused objects immediately, and uses a **cycle-detecting garbage collector** to clean up complex cases of circular references, helping manage memory efficiently without programmer intervention.\n"
