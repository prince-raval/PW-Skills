    "Ans:- Abstraction:\n",

    "Q.6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism where a new class, called a child or subclass, derives properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class, called a parent or superclass. This allows the child class to reuse, extend, or modify the functionality of the parent class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and helps create a natural \"is-a\" relationship between classes—for example, a Dog is an Animal. It also supports polymorphism, enabling different classes to be treated through a common interface."

    "Ans:- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of different classes to be treated through the same interface, allowing methods with the same name to behave differently based on the object that calls them. It enables objects of different types to be accessed through a common interface, where each type can provide its own implementation of a method. This promotes flexibility and extensibility in code, as the same method call can invoke different behaviors depending on the object's class.\n"

    "Q.8)  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to an object’s attributes and methods and controlling how they are accessed or modified. This is typically done by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using private variables:** Prefixing attribute names with double underscores (`__`) makes them private and prevents direct access from outside the class.\n",

    "2. **Providing getter and setter methods:** These methods allow controlled access to private attributes, enabling validation or other logic when retrieving or updating values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:- A constructor in Python is a special method named `__init__()` that is automatically called when a new object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object with specific values. The constructor sets up the initial state of the object, allowing you to pass values when creating an instance.\n",

    "Q.11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type) within the same class. However, unlike some other languages (like Java or C++), Python does not support true method overloading based on different parameter signatures. If you define multiple methods with the same name, the latest definition will overwrite the previous ones.\n",

    "Key reasons why polymorphism is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability:\n",
    "You can write generic code that works with objects of different classes, as long as they follow the same interface (e.g., have the same method names). This avoids duplicating code for each specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility:\n",
    "New classes can be added with their own unique behaviors without changing existing code that uses the polymorphic interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifies Code:\n",
    "It allows you to call the same method on different types of objects and get behavior appropriate to the object type, reducing the need for complex conditional statements.\n",

It contains one or more **abstract methods**, which are method declarations without implementations. These abstract methods must be overridden by any subclass that inherits from the abstract class. Abstract classes help enforce a consistent interface across different subclasses.\n",

    "In Python, abstract classes are created using the `abc` module by inheriting from `ABC` and decorating methods with `@abstractmethod`. Abstract classes can also include regular methods with full implementations. Since an abstract class cannot be instantiated, it ensures that only concrete subclasses that provide implementations for all abstract methods can be used to create objects.\n",

    "6. **Maintainability:**\n",
    "   OOP makes it easier to update and maintain code since related data and behavior are encapsulated, and changes in one part of the code have minimal impact elsewhere.\n",
